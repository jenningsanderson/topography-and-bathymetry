Global Topology / Bathymetry
===

Based primarily off [this post](https://www.helenmakesmaps.com/post/how-to-joy-plot), I wanted to make some global Joy Division plots.


### Obtaining Topography / Bathymetry Data
There are multiple ways to obtain these data: 

1. Download copernicus topography metadata per degree (the metadata has min, mean, max).
2. Download raster files using [github.com/jimutt/tiles-to-tiff](https://github.com/jimutt/tiles-to-tiff). 
3. Zonal stats were run on the GEBCO 2022 sub_ice_topo netcdf file.
